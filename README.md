# Inspecting a Dataset
As a data analyst, I use data to answer questions and solve problems. When I analyze data and draw conclusions, I generate insights that can influence business decisions, drive positive change, and help stakeholders meet their goals.<br> 
<br>Inspecting the dataset helps me pinpoint what questions are answerable and what data is still missing. I may be able to recover this data from an external source or at least recommend to stakeholders that another data source be used.<br>
## The Scenario
You are a data analyst working for an ice cream company. Management is interested in improving the company's ice cream sales.

The company has been collecting data about its sales—but not a lot. The available data is from an internal data source and is based on sales for 2019. You’ve been asked to review the data and provide some insight into the company’s ice cream sales. Ideally, management would like answers to the following questions:

1. What is the most popular flavor of ice cream?
2. How does temperature affect sales?
3. How does profitability differ for new versus returning customers?

### Inspect the data
<b>Question 1:</b> What is the most popular flavor of ice cream?<br>
To discover the most popular flavor, I first need to define what is meant by "popular." 
- Is the most popular flavor the one that generated the most revenue in 2019? 
- Or is it the flavor that had the largest number of units sold in 2019? <br>
Sometimes my measured choices are limited by what data I have & I can review spreadsheet to find out if either of these definitions of “popular” make sense based on the available data.  

Click the flavors sheet, it has three columns and 209 rows of data. The column headers are week, units sold, and flavor. This dataset did not come with a data description, so I have to figure out the significance of the columns on MY own. Based on the data, I deduce that these columns provide information about the number of units sold for each ice cream flavor, by week, in 2019.
