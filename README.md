# Inspecting-a-Dataset
As a data analyst, I use data to answer questions and solve problems. When I analyze data and draw conclusions, I generate insights that can influence business decisions, drive positive change, and help stakeholders meet their goals.  Inspecting the dataset helps me pinpoint what questions are answerable and what data is still missing. I may be able to recover this data from an external source or at least recommend to stakeholders that another data source be used.
